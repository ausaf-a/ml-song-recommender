<h2 id="introduction--background">Introduction / Background</h2>
<p>Within the Spotify app, recommendations are regularly made for its users through playlists in their “Made For You” category. However, such playlists often lack variability as they redundantly recommend the same songs or artists.</p>
<p>With data provided by Spotify, much research has gone into creating generic song recommending systems by both Spotify and external researchers. In 2019, Kehan Luo of the University of North Carolina used a support-vector network to classify songs into 10 different genres, with a surprisingly low 46.9% accuracy [1]. Additionally, in 2018, Georgieva, Suta, and Burton of Stanford were able to successfully determine whether a song became a Billboard Hot 100 hit with 75% accuracy using five machine learning algorithms, the most successful algorithms being a Logistic Regression and a Neural Network with one hidden layer [2]. Numerous other studies with different applications from these and our own have been completed. We will learn from these studies to strengthen our own approach.</p>
<h2 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition:</h2>
<p>We aim to create a recommendation service which provides users with songs they do not know from lesser-known artists. These songs will be based on clusters formed from relevant features such as genre, danceability, year, etc</p>
<h2 id="methods">Methods:</h2>
<p>We have found multiple datasets that highlight features of songs on Kaggle (for example [3]). Also, Spotify has an API tool that allows a user to extract the same details from a song, which can be used to generate additional datasets or pull song features if need be.</p>
<p>Using these datasets, we can use an unsupervised learning approach such as k-means or dbscan to form clusters from a dataset. These clusters represent similar music. Our goal is to then match a song to a similar cluster. The data points of this cluster are similar to the input song based on the features, therefore we can provide the data points of the cluster as song recommendations. To match a song to a cluster, an algorithm such as kth nearest neighbor can be used.</p>
<h2 id="potential-results--discussion">Potential Results / Discussion</h2>
<p>Our recommendation system is created by the clusters we formed using unsupervised learning. For example, say you listen to song A. We can then match song A with a cluster that is most similar to it, returning the data points of that cluster as song recommendations.</p>
